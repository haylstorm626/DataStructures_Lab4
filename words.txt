Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
We got to install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators we gotta move these color TV's
See the little faggot with the earring and the make up 
Yeah buddy that's his own hair 
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's a millionaire
We got to install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators we gotta move these color TV's
We got to install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators we gotta move these color TV's
I shoulda learned to play the guitar 
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama she got it stickin' in the camera man
We could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that?
Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee 
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free
We got to install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators we gotta move these color TV's
Listen here
Now that ain't workin' that's the way to do it 
Play the guitar on the MTV 
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
